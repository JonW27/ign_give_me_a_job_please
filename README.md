## Testing

My build environment was the latest version of flutter connected to VS code on Fedora 29 hooked up to an android phone running (gasp) marshmallow. I have not done any testing for iOS, it may or may not work (I don't have an iPhone). The target platform is therefore android.

## Oh noes. Your language is wrong! Dart isn't part of ...

I emailed and I was told Flutter would be ok for the app (in case not the same person).

## Stuff I wish I had the time and money for
* Use FF Din and Ars-Maquette
* Move scroll notification into Expanded
* Modularize the codebase way more
